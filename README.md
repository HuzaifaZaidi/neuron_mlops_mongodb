This is a lightweight Python package that simplifies working with MongoDB. It provides an easy-to-use interface for creating clients, connecting to databases, managing collections, inserting single or multiple records, and performing bulk inserts directly from CSV or Excel files. With built-in type safety checks and automatic handling of database/collection creation, it reduces boilerplate code and prevents common errors when interacting with MongoDB. Ideal for data engineering, ETL pipelines, and machine learning projects that require structured data storage and quick dataset imports into MongoDB.
